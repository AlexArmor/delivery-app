## Web application where users can order food delivery
This is a live page, [check it out](alexarmor.github.io/delivery-app/)
```
Using the sidebar, you can filter the stores that provide their products.
The user can choose the burger he likes by clicking the plus sign. The selected product will be placed in the cart, which in turn is stored in the local storage. The top navigation bar allows you to move between the product page and the shopping cart, where you can enter user data, check or edit the order itself, and send it for processing. Also, when you hover over the shopping cart link, a drop-down list of marked products will appear, which can be edited immediately before proceeding to checkout. When the user adds an item to the cart, a red circle lights up on the cart icon, indicating that the item has been added to the cart.
